# Tableau

Solved few tasks using the SQL and represented the data using Tableau.
employees_mod.zip contains a sample employee database which I used as a reference to solve the below tasks:\

Task 1: To create a visualization that provides a breakdown between the male and female employees working in the company each year, starting from 1990.\
Task 2: To compare the number of male managers to the number of female managers from different departments for each year, starting from 1990.\
Task 3: To compare the average salary of female versus male employees in the entire company until year 2002, and add a filter allowing you to see that per each department.\
Task 4: To create an SQL stored procedure that will allow you to obtain the average male and female salary per department within a certain salary range. This range be defined by two values the user can insert when calling the procedure.\
